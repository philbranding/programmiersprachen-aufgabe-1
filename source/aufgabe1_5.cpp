/* 

DECLARATION
The declaration means we are saying to a computer that this “thing” 
(it can be a variable, a function or a class) exists but we don’t know where. 
In the future, we may tell but right now it just exists somewhere. 
In simple words, we don’t allocate memory while declaring. 
We can declare that “thing” many times.

DEFINATION
The definition means we are saying to the computer that this “thing” needs memory 
and it needs to be located somewhere. In simple words, defining means we have allocated memory for it. 
We can define something only once

INTIALIZATION
The initialization means whatever our “thing “ is, we are giving it an initial value. 
That “thing” must be in some memory location and if we keep that location empty, it may be a house for bugs and errors. 
Initialization is not always necessary but it’s important.

//Example

//Variables

int var; 	 // declaration of a variable called var
var=10; 	 // initialize of the variable with a value of 10
int var=10;  // definetion of a memory space, calling it var and assigning a value of 10*/

//Functions
static int add(int,int); //declaration of the funtion called add that
